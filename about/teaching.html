                    <p> Curriculum digitization and user management. </p>
                    <p> Assisted with research on open source learning management systems. Developed a digital representation of our curriculum on the chosen system, <a href="https://www.openolat.com/">OpenOLAT</a>, and experimented with features to train colleagues and manage user rights. </p>

                    <p> Ages 7-14. 3 to 14 minutes. </p>
                    <p> Wrote and recorded a series intended to teach computer science concepts like conditionals, loops, and arrays in Javascript. Videos included concept overviews, code demonstrations, design exercises, debugging methods, and math skill sidebars. Goal of the series is to enable students to create browser-based games. </p>

                    <p> Ages 11 and up. 2 hour workshop. </p>
                    <p> Aimed at teaching the basics of the binary number system and logical relationships. Participants built logic gates with <a href="https://shop.elenco.com/consumers/brands/snap-circuits.html">Snap Circuit</a> toys and interacted with simulators to understand how circuit structures translated into logical operations. Participants engaged with exercises in binary counting and connecting binary values to “high” and “low” levels of electricity. </p>

                    <p> Ages 7-14. Multi-module self-paced project. </p>
                    <p> Wrote a multi-module capstone project in which beginning students receive guidance on creating their first complex project in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. Students complete modules of the project throughout their fundamental curriculum work as they learn new concepts, slowly adding features to create a two-player checker game. In addition to reinforcing new computer science concepts, these modules introduce students to managing all aspects of larger projects. </p>

                    <p> A medieval-themed role playing workshop, designed to encourage strategic and computational thinking. Participants formed “kingdoms” with various roles, like knight, blacksmith, or farmer, and had to prioritize retrieving items, doing puzzles, or completing tasks based on game objectives. </p>
