<h2> Sewing, Embroidery, and Crochet </h2>

<h3> Wellesley College Computer Science Department Graduation Stole </h3>
<p> i made my own stole for my graduation from Wellesley College. i selected the fabric, drafted a pattern, and hand-embroidered the computer science department logo for it. </p>

<h3> Winter Hat</h3>
<p> this was the first project i did on my first sewing machine. the end result reminded me of Sherlock Holmes' hat. it was <i>very</i> large on anybody but me - evidently my big head and fluffy hair make me a poor hat pattern model! </p>

<h3> Room Divider Curtain </h3>
<p> separation of space by function is a very helpful concept for helping my brain run well. so, to help me get through the last year of my bachelor's degree from my family's home (thanks COVID-19), i made a room divider curtain. </p>
<p> i chose a sunflower calico for one side, and a sunny yellow cotton for the other. this was before i got my sewing machine, so the stitching took a <b>long</b> time. i mounted picture hooks on opposite walls, and then i added cafe clips onto the picture wire. </p>
<p> the curtain turned out pretty heavy, being two large layers of cotton, but it did a great job at helping me work, in addition to brightening up my room! </p>
