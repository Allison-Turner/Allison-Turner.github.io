                  <p>Created an automated testing environment for the databases team. The environment's workflow was governed by <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins CI/CD</a> software. I automated repository access, Jenkins installation, and pipeline job creation through bash scripting. The various Jenkins jobs <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>ized or connected to test server instances of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017">Microsoft SQL Server 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2">IBM DB2</a> (both LUW and z/OS), and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">Oracle Database</a>, installed Pegasystems' back end on these platforms with <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> plugins, and ran Java test suites written by Pegasystems' engineers using more Gradle plugins. I added features to enable automated periodic testing, quick-start based on backups of previous installations, installing multitenant instances of Pegasystems' software, and more. I wrote extensive documentation for this environment and adapted both the documentation and the environment features based on user-testing with my department's engineers. This environment utilized existing artifactory repositories and plugins created by the dev ops team.</p>

                  <p>Prototyped version 3 of CRISPEE, a toy designed to educate kids ages 5 to 7 about genetics and bioengineering. The prototyping process included considering the results of previous user testing, cost-cutting measures, and creating sturdier electronics and body. Design sessions were followed by time spent working with Arduino-compatible consumer electronics such as those available on Adafruit, programming these electronics, designing the wooden pieces, and laser-cutting these pieces. After the redesign I helped to administer user testing at Boston Children's Museum and created a website documenting the construction of CRISPEEv3 for future replication.</p>

                  <p>Wrote QA testing in C# and using Selenium for subscribers' customized instances of Aras Innovator, a product lifetime management software. The tests that I wrote were used to verify that version migrations and fixes did not recreate past issues and were assimilated into a larger body of Aras QA testing. Tests were based on scenarios described in resolved support tickets. I became very familiar with the structure of the software client's browser interface in order to navigate it effectively with Selenium. After writing a large body of tests for a handful of different clients, I collaborated with another engineering office to identify and correct inconsistencies and failings of Aras' current testing framework</p>

                  <p>Created a proof-of-concept system to prove the viability of peer-to-peer optimizations of livestreaming optimizations. Performed a literature search for current architectures and already attempted media peering schemes. Emulated a simple topology in Mininet, wrote a simplified livestreaming application with FFmpeg and MPlayer, wrote a peering-capable router with OpenFlow and using a POX controller, and viewed network traffic with Wireshark. Found demonstrable decreases in latency using peered connections to audience members.</p>
